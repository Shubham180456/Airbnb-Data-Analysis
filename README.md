# Airbnb Data Analysis & Performance Optimization

# Project Overview

The **Airbnb Data Analysis & Performance Optimization** project aims to provide actionable insights into Airbnb listings by analyzing key metrics such as ratings, pricing, demand trends, and host performance. The goal of this project is to help Airbnb hosts and stakeholders optimize their listings by identifying the factors that drive guest satisfaction, the pricing strategies that maximize revenue, and the seasonal trends that affect booking demand.

This project uses various data analysis techniques to clean, explore, and model the data to forecast future demand and offer recommendations for improving listing performance. The analysis is geared towards Airbnb hosts and business analysts who want to enhance customer satisfaction and increase revenue.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of Airbnb listings that include fields such as:
- **City**: The city where the listing is located.
- **Listing Name**: The name of the listing.
- **Overall Rating**: The guest rating (out of 100) provided for the listing.
- **Price**: The price per night for the listing.
- **Review Date**: The date when a guest review was posted.

This dataset is used to analyze trends, pricing strategies, and guest satisfaction across various Airbnb listings.

# Project Workflow

The project follows a structured workflow that includes the following tasks:

# **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Convert date columns (e.g.Review data) to the appropriate format for time series analysis.
- Handle missing data by removing rows with critical missing values (e.g.Overall Rating and Price).
- Remove duplicate records and ensure data integrity.
  
# **2. Descriptive Data Analysis**
- Compute summary statistics for Overall Rating and Price.
- Analyze the distribution of prices and ratings to identify high- and low-performing listings.
- Identify any outliers in pricing or rating to flag unusual listings.

# **3. City-Based Performance Insights**
- Analyze the number of listings per city to identify which cities have the most Airbnb activity.
- Compare average price and rating across cities to find top-performing locations.
- Highlight the top 5 highest-rated listings by city and provide insights into pricing and guest satisfaction.

# **4. Demand and Pricing Trends**
- Aggregate review data by date to analyze daily demand patterns and price fluctuations.
- Identify seasonal trends by analyzing the variance in prices and demand during peak and off-peak seasons.
- Investigate the price elasticity of demand to understand how price changes impact booking rates.

# **5. Advanced Data Analysis**
- Correlation analysis between price and overall rating to determine if there is a relationship between price and guest satisfaction.
- Perform clustering of listings based on similarity in price, rating, and location to find patterns.
- Segment listings by property type (e.g., apartment, house) to see how different types of properties perform in terms of pricing and guest ratings.

# **6. Time Series Forecasting**
- Build and evaluate time series models (e.g., ARIMA) to forecast future demand based on historical data.
- Forecast peaks in demand and suggest pricing and availability strategies for hosts during high-traffic periods.
  
# **7. Key Insights and Recommendations**
- Identify factors that lead to high guest satisfaction and suggest improvements for underperforming listings.
- Provide recommendations on dynamic pricing strategies, seasonal marketing, and customer retention strategies.

# **8. Business Strategy Development**
- Develop marketing strategies for peak and off-peak seasons.
- Provide a host retention strategy to ensure consistent bookings and high ratings.
  
# **9. Create Visualizations and Reports**
- Create visualizations for price distributions, rating distributions, and demand trends.
- Compile the findings and insights into a comprehensive final report for stakeholders.
